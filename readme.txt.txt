In data mining and machine learning, the Apriori algorithm is a popular approach for frequent itemset mining. A bottom-up method that gradually raises the amount of candidate itemsets is used to locate all frequent itemsets in a given dataset. An insight that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent serves as the foundation for the procedure.

The production of candidate itemsets and the trimming of infrequent itemsets are the two primary processes in the implementation of the Apriori algorithm. Based on the frequent itemsets of size k-1, the algorithm creates a list of candidate itemsets of size k in the first step. The dataset is then counted to discover which of these candidate itemsets are frequent and which are rare.
